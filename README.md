# professional-portfolio-lee
## Portfolio showcase of projects that I've done.

## Description
I created this webpage to display a professional portfolio containing my projects, contact information, and a little biography of myself. This project was good review and test of what I've learned so far with my limited knowledge on HTML, CSS, and a little bit of js.

## Installation
All you have to do is access the deployed URL provided here:
https://kushonim.github.io/professional-portfolio-lee/

## Usage
Upon opening the webpage, you have the option to scroll through and observe the portfolio. Otherwise, if there is a specific section you'd like to see, there are nav links at the top. You can also interact with the available deployed projects at the bottom by clicking the image/box.
